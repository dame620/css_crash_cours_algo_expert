-margin: with vertical alignement the margin will colllapse 
meaning we will just use which margin is bigger and don't add them if there is 
two margin between two element
-with horizontal margin we will just adding them rather than tacking the larger one
*/
/*
-If we use: margin with two value it will be just first value will be refer to top and
bottom and the second value will be refer to right and left margin: 24px 53px;
-If we use margin with auto the value will be for centring element.
- margin: 16px auto; will set top and bottom margin of 16px and center horizontaly don't
forget in this case to set a width to the element if this is element of type block or 
display is block and take the width of the entire page
-if we set a margin to an inline element if will be set horizontaly, margin has no affect
to an inline element verticaly becarfuly inline-block act as block with margin
Exemple this will set margin horizintaly only but for padding it will be apply vertically 
and horizontaly
em {
    margin: 42px;
    padding: 14px;
}

/*
radius is the half of the diametre setting border radius to the half of the size of the 
element we are setting it to the exact length of the element which is creating the exact circle
border-radius is for round the border but if we wanna get a circle(cercle) we have to
get an square(carr√©) same width and height and apply border radius to 50%
EXEMPLE:
width: 450px;
height: 450px
border-radius: 50%;
